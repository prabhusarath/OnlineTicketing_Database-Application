Online Ticketing and Theatre Management System
Entertainment is one of the most sought after things in today’s fast paced and stressful life. One mode of entertainment is watching movies. For that, we go to theatres and that’s where our application comes into play. This application provides user with an easy and interactive way of dealing with theatre. In this the public user can select from the movies being screened in a theatre group located at various locations in a city like Chicago, buy tickets online and can easily go and enjoy the movie and the whole theatre experience. He can see other people’s review of the movie, the theatre and can choose accordingly. After the show, he can himself go and start a thread for reviewing or posting comments on the movie or theatre or anything he likes. In that way, he becomes the member of the theatre and hence, gets points on his reviews etc. He can also become Silver, Gold or Platinum member depending on the credit points he earned and get incentives accordingly. In short, our application takes a user’s theatre experience to the next level.
In this application, we have a theatre group that has theatre’s at several locations in the city. A user who wants to see a movie goes to the movie site, where he can have a look on the movies being screened in the theatres, their timings and the location of theatre’s according to his zip code. He can also read movie reviews, their ratings and other stuff about the theatre etc at the discussion board of the site. He can buy the ticket either as a guest or a registered user. 

Theatres and Movies
Once a user visits the theatre’s site, he can find the addresses of the theatres, what movies are being played in each theatre and at their playing schedule. He can find the titles of the movies, the stars and director of the movie, what type of movie it is (drama, adventure, sci-fi, love story, comedy, or family and only these types), and a short description of the movie. A movie can be of several types (an adventure drama, a sci-fi love story, for examples).
He can also read reviews on the theatres and the movies. He can vote on whether he likes or dislikes a particular review.
A theatre has one or more screens. Each screening room has a fixed capacity. A movie can be shown on more than one theater, on more than one screen at the same time or at different times.
Membership
The general public can obtain the information in the site as described above. If he buys a ticket, he becomes a guest. He just have to enter his name, credit card number, phone number, emailId and the location where he wants to watch the movie and the ticket will be booked. 

If he wants to register to the site, then the first time he starts his registration, he has to provide details like his UserId, Password, emailId, credit card number, credit card type (Visa, Master Card), expiration date of the credit card, his phone number and address. His Id is created on the site. In addition to buying tickets online, the registered user can review theatres and movies. He can earn credit points on the money that he spent on the theatre, and on the reviews that he wrote. Once he accumulated certain credit points, he achieves membership status of SILVER, GOLD and PLATINUM progressively. He can use his credit points to claim rewards. Using credit points to claim reward does not affect his progression to membership status. The theatre chain administration sets the policy of earning points and using them.
Next time when the registered user enters his Login information (UserId and Password) he sees his homepage, movies being screened, movie timings, credit points he earned, his membership status and also the discussion rooms and the current discussions going on. He will also see recommendation on his favorites based on types of movies that he has seen in the last 30days. 
Discussion Forum
The discussion topics are grouped as Movies and Theater Experience. Any registered user can start a thread about any of the above but the guest can only read the threads. 
A discussion forum thread in the movies group must identify its subjects to a combination of movie title, stars and director names. A discussion forum thread in the theatre experience group must identify the location of the theatre.
A registered user may get credit points based on his activities (writing and expressing opinions on reviews) on the discussion forum. The theatre administration sets the policy of how to award the credit points.
Theatre Staff and Functions
In the theater we have the Owner, Administrator of the website, and Managers at different locations, ticketing staff, Cleaning staff, Security and Snack Service Providers. 
For each of the staff members a short description of their duties must be stored. Each staff member is hired by either the owner or the manager of that location. Owner or the managers can assign the job types to the employees. 
For each staff member, details like his name, address, phone number, location where he works and ssn must be stored. 
The schedule of the employees will be decided by the managers or the owner. The schedule will provide information like when (date and time) the employee is working, job type and location. The manager or the owner can decide on what all deals or discounts or special offers they want to offer to the customers. They also set the policy on how the credit points are earned and may be spent. More specifically, they set the number of points to be awarded to how much money is spent by the member and to good reviews judged by the managers.
The owner and the web administrator have all the privilege to see and update all the tables and the data in the tables. The owner can delegate privileges to employees in the theatre.
